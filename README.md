## 🎓 Master thesis
<b>Convex Optimization Meets Attention: Mathematical Insights into Transformers and LLM</b>

My master thesis explores the mathematical foundations of modern deep learning with an emphasis on practical transformer architectures.
This work includes an implementation-from-scratch of a <b>convexified Transformer</b> model to study the effect of reformulated attention
mechanisms on model performance. The goal is to bridge theoretical optimization principles with practical deep learning architectures used
in modern AI systems.

### Thesis focus
- Attention mechanisms viewed through an <b>optimization lens</b> (reformulations, relaxations, constraints)
- A clean <b>from-scratch implementation</b> of a convexified Transformer variant
- Empirical study via <b>ablation</b>, <b>stability</b>, and <b>performance</b> metrics
